# University of Milhomens
_Note: This is a mock project. It should not be understood as something real._

Nowadays, there seems to be a great deal of hype around blockchain technologies. Sometimes it's because of their innovative capacities, but other times it's just a trend. But one thing is for sure: they have an aura that makes us see them as something trustworthy, even if we don't know what that means.

At the same time, in a society obsessed with degrees and certifications, we find too easily that unreliable sources use fancy names like “institute” and “university,” and offer degrees and certifications at high prices, even though there is no official validation of whether students with those documents have any particular knowledge or skill.

This is where the University of Milhomens comes in: it’s a small project I created for fun where everyone can get the title they want from a mock university. It will be blockchain-validated for as long as the blockchain keeps running (currently, it’s only deployed on the Sepolia Test-Net). That’s why the university is called this. “Milhomens,” in Catalan, means someone who thinks they are fit for everything, who wants to intervene in everything, and wants to know everything (DIEC2).

To try this project, you can access its IPFS page (you'll need a web3 provider and some Sepolia test-net eth): https://dweb.link/ipfs/QmPFun5qNEgVCyxsqxEaSGH2Ve26W5MWegPTCiea4smRYc

Or interact directly with the contract on the Sepolia Test-Net: 0x60178B17a568b906ADbB366dB5c66ADef6410cBe
